								The Tannehill Woodcarvers Club was chartered in 1985 for the purpose of promoting the art of wood carving, to acquaint the general public with sculpturing in wood and to bring back and preserve the almost lost art of woodcarving. Tannehill Woodcarvers meets at the Tannehill State Park in the Cane Creek School on the 2nd Saturday of each month.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p class="style3 text-left">
								We have about 80 members, with about 30 attending on a typical Club meeting day. We are just a group of men and women that love to carve and have a good time of fellowship with one another. Club day will usually start about 8:00 am and go to 2:00 or 3:00 pm. So, bring a sandwich and a positive attitude that you want to carve or learn to carve.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p class="style3 text-left">
								Please come and visit us. If you decide you want to join as a member, dues are only $20 a year.
